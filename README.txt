       Jmol: An open-source Java/SwingJS application for the visualization and 
             analysis of 3D molecular structures with features for chemicals, 
             crystals, materials and biomolecules. Written in Java; debugs and
             runs in both Java and JavaScript.
             
      JSmol: A modular web app derived in real time from Jmol, with options to
             render with or without WebGL.
             
  JSpecView: An open-source Java/SwingJS application for working with spectral 
             NMR, IR, GC, GC/MS, UV/VIS, and general specral data. Written in 
             Java; debugs and runs in both Java and JavaScript. 
            
Java2Script: An Eclipse-based transpiler for creating JavaScript from Java, 
             generating both Java class files and their corresponding essentially
             identical JavaScript equivalents, allowing for immediate debugging
             in both languages. 
 
    SwingJS: A nearly complete Java Swing-based virtual machine running in 
             JavaScript; accommodates non-Swing and non-AWT Java applets and 
             applications as well, allowing them to work both in the standard 
             stand-along Java fashion, embedded in web pages, or in frames 
             on top of web pages.

This site is the new home of the development of all of the tools listed above. 
Formerly, all development on these projects were at SourceForge, and that 
site (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol/) is still the official
site for Jmol, JSmol, and JSpecView. However, all future development is 
expected to be here on GitHub.

The goal of this site is to fully integrate Jmol and JSpecView into SwingJS so that
they can run alongside other SwingJS applications such as VARNA and many, many
other applets.   

Status: Jmol 15.0.1 is running fully as a SwingJS application.
        JSpecView/HTML5 has not been tested.
