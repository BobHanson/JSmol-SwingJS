       Jmol: an open-source SwingJS application for the visualization and 
             analysis of 3D molecular structures with features for chemicals, 
             crystals, materials and biomolecules. Written in Java
      JSmol: a modular web app derived in real time from Jmol, with options to
             use WebGL or not (the default)
  JSpecView: an open-source SwingJS application for working with spectral 
             NMR, IR, GC, GC/MS, UV/VIS, and general specral data
            
Java2Script: an Eclipse-based transpiler for creating JavaScript from Java 
    SwingJS: a nearly complete Java Swing-based virtual machine running in 
             JavaScript

This site is the new home of the development of all of the tools listed above. 
Formerly, all development on these projects were at SourceForge, and that 
site (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol/) is still the official
site for Jmol, JSmol, and JSpecView. However, all future development is 
expected to be here on GitHub.

The goal of this site is to fully integrate Jmol and JSpecView into SwingJS so that
they can run alongside other SwingJS applications such as VARNA and many, many
other applets.   

Status: Jmol is running as a SwingJS application, though some aspects (menu, console)
        have not been hooked up yet. JSpecView has not been tested.
