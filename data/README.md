# Instructions for testing file data reading

1) Import the Jmol-datafiles project as git/Jmol-datafiles  (it must have this name).

2) run test/org/jmol/adapter/smarter/TestSmarterJmolAdapter.java as a JUnit test. 

If for some reason you need a different name, just adjust the file name declaration at that start of that java file.
